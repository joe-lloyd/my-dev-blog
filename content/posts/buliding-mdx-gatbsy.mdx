## Introduction: The Vision

I built this blog back at the start of 2024. It came from a want to share what i've learned in my first decade of coding.
My backend skills were rusty after spending 5 years on frontend development at Polestar. So I opted for an all-in-one platform, gatsby.
Gatsby is good for this use case since SEO & SSR are king in blogging.
As for data storage, I wanted to keep it simple and avoid databases. That's where MDX came in. The cool thing about it is that through gatsby we still get a graphql layer to query our data.
Its flexible as well, since we can just add react components to our markdown files.

## Starting the Project

I setup basic Gatbsy project with the gatsby-cli. Using Gatsby is like a double-edged sword, it's great because it's a powerful build tool but it obfuscates a lot of the underlying process.
I generally use npx to avoid global installations.

```bash
npx gatsby new my-mdx-site
```

## Integrating MDX

The Problem I Wanted to Solve was that writing markdown felt limiting because I wanted dynamic elements in blog posts.
But I didn't want to use a database and manage migrations etc. plus hosting is cheaper with static sites.

```bash
npm install gatsby-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/react
```

Just update the config to include the plugin. Here I also use the gatsby-remark-prismjs plugin for syntax highlighting.

```javascript
const config: GatsbyConfig = {
  plugins: [
  // Other plugins...
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
      options: {
        gatsbyRemarkPlugins: [
          {
            resolve: `gatsby-remark-prismjs`,
            options: {},
          },
          {
            resolve: `gatsby-remark-images`,
            options: {
              maxWidth: 590,
            },
          },
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Adding Dynamic Features

In MDX we have access to react components. So that means we can use Gatbsy's Link component to link to other pages in our site.
You can see it working with <Link to="/">this link</Link> to the home page.

```md
import { Link } from "gatsby";

## Adding Dynamic Features

You can see it working with <Link to="/">this link</Link> to the home page.
```

## Gatsby & GraphQL

The Mdx Files have a list at the top of the file, this is called frontmatter and we can query it with graphql.
This is great because when we generate pages for each post we can get the frontmatter like metadata for the post.

```mdx
---
title: "How I Built My this blog with Gatsby and MDX"
author: "Joe"
date: "2024-12-14"
slug: "/mdx-gatsby-blog"
---

MDX content/body here
```

Then in the page templates we can query the data with graphql.

```graphql
query BlogPostPage($id: String!) {
  mdx(id: { eq: $id }) {
    id
    frontmatter {
      slug
      title
      author
      date(formatString: "YYYY, DD MMM")
    }
  }
}
```

## Styling with Bulma

I wanted to keep the styling simple so I used Bulma. I installed it with npm and added the scss files to the gatsby-browser.js file.
Then just impot everything in my base scss file.

```scss
@import "~bulma/sass/utilities/_all";
@import "~bulma/sass/helpers/_all";

// You can just modify bulma variables to customize the theme
$navbar-background-color: red;
$navbar-item-color: white;
$navbar-item-hover-color: blue;
```

## Generating Types

If you check the codebase you'll see that its mainly written in typescript. I generated types for the graphql queries with the gatsby plugin gatsby-plugin-typegen.

```bash
npm install gatsby-plugin-typegen
```

In the package.json there's a script to generate the types. I always add core scripts here, the package.json is the first place I look when I open a new project.
It should tell me how to run the project, test it, and build it.

```json
"scripts": {
  "generate": "graphql-codegen --config codegen.yml"
}
```

These are not tracked since a user should generate their own types locally.
Principally because generated code shouldn't be tracked, think about it like npm modules.

## Deploying

I pushed the code to [github](https://github.com/joe-lloyd/my-dev-blog) and set up a hook for [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
This will trigger a build every time a new commit is pushed to the main branch. Since the app is statically generated, it's fast and cheap (free) to host.

## Conclusion

I'm happy enough with the result since its very easy to deploy more posts & if I want something custom in the code I can just add a react component.
The site is fast and cheap to host.
I kept things simple with Bulma SCSS for styling with primsjs for syntax highlighting.
