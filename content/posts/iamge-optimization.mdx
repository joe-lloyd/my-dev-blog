I'm going to be real with you from the get go, the title & thumb are bait. Rust is fast, very fast and faster than JS in almost every metric.
But what I found out when I tried to optimize my blog images shocked me.

## The Why/What

So I have a [site](https://minis.joe-lloyd.com/) where I show off pictures of my models that I've painted over the years. It's nothing special, just JAM stack with next.js and mdx.
Since we're talking about a lot of images and a static site I decided I needed to optimize the images I have, so I can store them cheaply and serve them quickly.
I also need to do some videos and I want to upload them to an s3 bucket, so I need to optimize them too.

I want to make 1 image into 5 images

```js
const sizes = {
  thumbnail: 480,
  small: 600,
  medium: 800,
  large: 1200,
  extraLarge: 1920,
};
```

The thumbnail image will be cropped to a square as well as resized. All images we be transformed to webp format.

## JS Everything

So since I'm a basic React Andy I decided to use JS for everything. I used `sharp` for images and `ffmpeg` for videos.
I wrote some scripts, basic JS plumbing. I just had to install the packages and run the scripts. It works, it makes all my images and videos
the correct size and format.

But, I've recently been watching [ThePrimeagen](https://youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen) and he's been basically calling me out, feelsbatman.jpg.
So I decided to look into the right tool for the job instead of the tool I know for the job.

## Lets Rust

This led me to Rust. I've never written any rust before, but I've heard its crazy fast.
It looks complicated but the task I wanna do is simple enough (implementing libs that smarter people than me wrote).
For starters I'm sure Chat Gippity can guide me.

My first attempt sucks, I end up processing one image after another instead of batching. Its slow but technically it works.

Lets see if video processing works better/faster.

...ffmpeg path or installation is busted (somehow it works with Node but not Rust)...

For now, I'm skipping the video part. Lets go back and make the image processing faster. To increase speed I need to
look into parallel processing. So I find this library called [rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon). It's a data parallelism library for Rust.

```rust
use rayon::prelude::*;
```

It makes it a lot faster, but I'm still not happy with the speed. I was pretty sure the Node implementation was faster,
but it had been a couple of days since I ran it so I decided to make some benchmarks.

# Benchmark

For the test I used everything I had which is only 21 images.
This becomes 105 images after the transformation.

Our results for Rust

```bash
$ Image processing completed in 175.91s seconds.
```


Our results for Node

```bash
$ Total Processing Time: 3.591s
```

I was shocked, how bad can my Rust code be that Node is faster?? I was kinda annoyed that I spent time on a slower solution but I
decided to make this a learning opportunity, lets go deeper, why is Rust slower?

# Findings & Conclusion

My initial thought was that my Rust code sucks, we all know that Chat Gippity is a Jr dev and actually nothing special when it comes to code quality.
So, yeah, the code probably sucks, you can make up your own mind by looking in the [repo as the image_processing.rs file](https://github.com/joe-lloyd/rusty-media-optimizer/blob/master/src/image_processing.rs).
But actually I'm gonna rug pull you and tell you we were't really comparing Node to Rust, since the Node script was using the sharp package. Sharp is a C++ library that is wrapped in JS, so all the "heavy lifting" is done in C++.
So, Rust is still fast, but not as fast as C++.

As an additional side note, I was also using the [webp library for rust](https://github.com/jaredforth/webp/) & I read that it's just not a fast formatter.

It was a fun and eye-opening experiment, its always good to go a little deeper, understand what packages you're using and what they're doing under the hood.
